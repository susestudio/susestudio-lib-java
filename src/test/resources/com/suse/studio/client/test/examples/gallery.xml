      <description>MiniSUSE comes with all the great packages you might need. It offers you a +Swiss army knife for all your Linux needs+ - still it is +small+ enough to fit a CD/DVD or USB drive. You can use it to rescue systems, format drives, check sensors or hack whatever you want. If you are looking for a small, but extremely useful Linux distribution you can +get up and running in seconds+ from the media of your choice, look no further :)

Now with *IceWM* and *YaST2*!

NOTE: 12.2 version does not boot properly. Working on it.</description>

      <description>NOTE: a new version written from scratch will be out soon, including a modern SDK and less errors in building!

bgta's Android developer desktop is a great idea, but there is a problem: it's filled with tons of cruft not needed for a developer's desktop like Tomboy, GIMP and Empathy, and added some useful things like a git GUI. I've drastically decreased the size of the appliance with these changes.

I try and improve on their appliance with this. Also, I've switched out the PAE kernel with the standard one, to help it run on more devices.</description>

      <description>*NOTICE: Our site is under construction. Please keep up with the lastest releases here on SUSE Studio, til the Upstream OS site is updated. Version 8 can be found here on SUSE Studio, not on our site.*

*THERE ARE TWO VERSION OF VERSION 8 – PLEASE READ*
Version 8.0.0 is available in multiple formats.
Version 8.0.1 is the same OS, just in Preloaded ISO format. *WARNING:* This is not a LiveCD. This will erase all data on the hardrive. Be careful of that.

One of SUSE Studios most cloned, highest-rated, and popular operating systems is back up-to-date. Presenting Upstream OS 8.

Upstream OS 8 marks a new path of development. In the past, Upstream releases either favored developers (low file size, less apps) or consumers (larger file size, more apps). Version 8 brings us down the middle. New apps have been added like Firefox, GIMP, Thunderbird, and office software for consumers. While php5-mysql and other features have been added for developers.

Upstream OS 8 also introduces a built-in firewall, and auto-updater with online security and software updates. U OS 8 is the most complete release yet.

For beauty, the new OS features an updated green logo, and beautiful new HD wallpaper. Simple beauty, with plenty of options thanks to Compiz, and other programs.

New logo, new wallpaper. New platform.

Upstream now runs on openSUSE 12.1.

Changes in Version 8:
-Upgraded to openSUSE 12.1
-HD wallpaper
-Games package added
-GNOME games added
-Audacity &amp; Amarok added
